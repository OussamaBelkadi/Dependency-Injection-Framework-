# Dependency Injection Framework From Scratch (Spring Boot Replica)
## Part One: Scanning Classes

This project is the **first part** of a series that demonstrates how to build a **Dependency Injection (DI) Framework** from scratch, inspired by **Spring Boot**. It focuses on **class scanning**, a key feature for detecting and managing components dynamically.

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Learn
- How dependency injection works under the hood
- Implementing classpath scanning to detect annotated components
- Using reflection to process classes dynamically
- The foundation for a custom DI framework

## ðŸŽ¯ Who Is This For?
- **Developers** who want to **understand the internals** of DI frameworks
- **Students** looking to enhance their **Java and reflection** skills
- **Anyone** interested in **building a lightweight DI container** from scratch

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17+**
- **Maven or Gradle** for dependency management

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
